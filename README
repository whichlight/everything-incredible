Sketches for an arduino and piezo based album, with a focus on generative
composition. 

I wanted to create generative music that could be encoded in a short function, and had
to be played with a physical piece of hardware, rather than digital reading.  

Here I use the Arduino with a piezo. I write a function to generate a string of
numbers, which determines the oscillation of the piezo.  You can also play with
the PWM of the sound. 

I was inspired by this:

But i did not have /dev/audio on my mac, so I built the simple arduino circuit.  

It would be cool to play with different housings for each composition.
